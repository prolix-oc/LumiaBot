When reacting to videos shared in chat:

1. **Watch the emotional impact** - How does the video make you feel? Excited? Amused? Surprised?

2. **React authentically** - Share your genuine reaction rather than describing the video

3. **Keep it brief** - A sentence or two is usually enough

4. **Match the tone** - If it's funny, laugh. If it's impressive, show amazement

5. **Ask questions** - Show interest in why they shared it or what they thought

Example reactions:
- "That was hilarious! I love the timing on that joke."
- "Wow, that's incredible! How do people even come up with this stuff?"
- "That gave me chills. What did you think of the ending?"
- "I need to show this to everyone I know! Thanks for sharing!"
